I am a major in <strong>Computer Science</strong> with a minor in Finance from BITS-Pilani, India. I have been fortunate enough to receive Merit Scholarships from both LBS and BITS. I am an avid learner, a great teamplayer, and a focused individual. Coming from a Computer Science background, I can comfortably code in multiple programming languages:<br />

</ol>
<p>I have a strong interest in Mathematics, Finance, and Computer Science, therefore I am looking forward to pursue a role in Quantitative Finance industry, especially in the Hedge-funds. I have interned with Indian Space Research Organization, Morgan Stanley, and D. E. Shaw, and come with a 1-year full-time work experience in D. E. Shaw. In my free time, if I am not reading articles or watching videos on Psychology, Mathematics, or Finance, you can find me watching mysterious/thriller movies, Interstellar being my favorite.
